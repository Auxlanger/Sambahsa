## Sounds

The pronunciation of Sambahsa words can be explained using a set of phonetic symbols known as Sambahsa Phonetic Transcription (SPT). This document instead uses the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) for this purpose.

The author treats Sambahsa as being comprised of *orthographical units* (such as **eau**, **oh** and **uy**), each of which represents one and only one *sound* (such as, respectively, /oː/, /oː/ and /uːi/) but carefully understanding that a *sound* may consist of more than one phoneme.

On each line of the table below, normal Sambahsa spelling of an of *orthographical unit* such as **ai** is shown first in bold green, followed by SPT such as [ä] in square brackets and then IPA such as /ɛ/ between forward slashes. An underscore such as in **ch**_ or \_**y**\_ means 'any consonant.' A question mark such as in **e**? means 'in some positions only.' (To see colour, download README.html.)

Unfortunately, several Sambahsa phonemes will be difficult for English speakers. For some of these the author has in parentheses indicated a suggested ***compromise*** for English speakers. However, [e] should always be pronounced as the pure vowel /e/ as in French <i>caf<b>é</b></i> and never as the diphthong /eɪ/ as in d<b>ay</b>, otherwise confusion will occur between **e** and **ei** (both of which occur frequently).

To avoid confusion, this document uses /ɑ/ for [a]. The French-dictionary IPA symbol /a/ is used for [a] in the official Sambahsa documentation; that is an open front unrounded vowel sound very close to the open back unrounded vowel sound /ɑ/ and the difference is of no importance to being understood in Sambahsa. The sound /æ/ as in "c<b>a</b>t" does not occur in Sambahsa.

According to its inventor, Sambahsa has no real phonotactics, it only has rules of orthography and rules of accentuation, and this was intentional; that is, this was fully a design decision and not an oversight. Therefore it is impossible to list the rules of phonotactics because no such rules are defined other than those implied by the rules of accentuation. Other than checking to see if a proposed new word would violate the rules of the orthography or would not seem to be addressed by the existing rules of accentuation, it is therefore sometimes difficult to ascertain if a proposed new word would be legal or illegal.

Since Sambahsa has no defined system of phonotactics, the author has abandoned his attempt to list an inventory of Sambahsa phonemes, including elucidating the number of short vowels, long vowels, consonants, semivowels and so on in Sambahsa, because in view of the above he finds it impossibly difficult to do so. However, as a compromise, the known sounds listed below are subsequently grouped into categories.
